# Contrast-Based-Filtering-for-Salient-Region-Detection
This is an attempt to implement the research paper, Saliency Filters: Contrast Based Filtering for Salient Region Detection

## Usage:
    python3 Saliency_Filter.py <location_of_file_along_with_filename>
    
## Information:
    The file Saliency_Filter.py is stored in /code/src
    The output images will be stored at the same location as the input image location.
   
## Python Modules needed:
  - skimage
  - matplotlib.pyplot
  - cv2
  - numpy
  - sys
