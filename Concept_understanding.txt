1.)Abstraction: Splitting Images into so called "elements" which represent relevant features of the images by abstracting 
unnecessary details, by clustering pixels. These "elements" should be perceptually homongeneous i.e., the discontinuties 
between these elements which represents the useful info of sharp edges of the overall image should be preserved.

2.)Element Uniqueness:Evaluate how different each respective element is from all other elements constituting an image,
essentially measuring the “rarity” of each element

3.) Element distribution:which renders unique elements more salient when they are grouped in a particular image region rather than evenly
distributed over the whole image.

4.) Saliency Assignment: The two above contrast measures are defined on a per-element level. In a final step, we
assign the actual saliency values to the input image to get a pixel-accurate saliency map.
