Images are represented as a grid of pixels, in either single or multiple channels.

We take these M x N pixel grids and then apply algorithms to them. 

The problem is that our pixel grid is by no means a natural representation of an image.

Taken as a whole, this grouping of pixels as a pixel grid is simply an artifact of an image â€” part of the process of capturing and creating digital images.
That leads us to superpixels.

Intuitively, it would make more sense to explore not only perceptual, but semantic meanings of an image formed by locally grouping pixels 
as well.When we perform this type of local grouping of pixels on our pixel grid, we arrive at superpixels.

These superpixels carry more perceptual and semantic meaning than their simple pixel grid counterparts.

BENEFITS: 
- Computational efficiency
- Perceptual meaningfulness
- Oversegmentation
- efficient graph representations across regions of the image.
