Saliency Assignment has two parts:
1.)The first part uses the values of the Uniqueness and Distribution Matrxi to produce a Saliency Matrix using the relation
   Si= Ui * exp(-K*Di)
2.) But directly translating this to every pixel of each of the segments in Image carries over all segmentation errors 
of abstraction algorithm.Hence we make use of the weighted linear combination of previously obtained Saliency Map and regenerate a new Saliency map using this linear combination and assign it to each pixel of the appropriate segments.
